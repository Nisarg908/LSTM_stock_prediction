### Project Title: 
Predicting Stock Open Price using LSTM

### Project Description:
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock open prices based on historical data sourced from Yahoo Finance. The repository includes the implementation of an LSTM model in TensorFlow/Keras, along with demonstrations of overfitting mitigation techniques and optimization strategies.

### Contents:
1. **Work Report Project File**: Detailed documentation of the project including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and results analysis.
2. **TVSMOTOR.NS.csv**: CSV file containing historical stock data used for training and testing the model.
3. **Model Train Save and Prediction**: Saved model files and code for prediction using the trained model.

### Key Features:
- Design of LSTM-based neural network model for stock open price prediction.
- Demonstration of overfitting mitigation using Dropout technique.
- Utilization of Adam optimizer for model training and optimization.

### Usage:
1. Run the provided scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

### Instructions:
- Refer to the work report project file for comprehensive documentation of the project workflow, methodology, and results analysis.
